    4 basic stats:
      combat-skills for each weapon type    [fitness]
      scholar-skills for each god or art    [intellect]
      craft-skills for each item-type       [diligence]
      dialog-skills for each tribe or class [charm]
      ranged vs. melee, evasion & resistance
      damage vs. armour, speed & sight-range
      male vs. female, age & race, orientation & presentation
    
    * Hunting is undertaken spontaneously by off-duty nobles (including
      knights,) to hunt beasts or explore forest.
    * Trials are used to offer a prize for completing a specific task, such as
      exploration, single combat, etc.  Not something you'd use ane entire army
      for- more like a sporting event to deal with a local nuisance, boost
      morale, and single out champions for recruitment.  Like a tourney.
    * Finally warfare (and variations like garrisoning, escort and patrol duty,
      or even diplomatic envoys,) is used for other cities or civil defence.

        [Order, Chaos, Life, Death][Earth, Air, Water, Fire]

  Calendar:
    18 months of 20 'Days' per year 
    Have 'night' synchronise with the lunar calendar- 14 days of light and dark
    in alternation.  That gives you a plausible time-scale for sleeping, chats,
    et cetera.  And then the sequences of festivals can punctuate these
    environmental differences.
